# 📱 Product Review Application

**Backend:** Spring Boot (Java)
**Frontend:** React Native (Expo) - *Reference Implementation*
**Database:** H2 (Dev) / PostgreSQL (Prod)
**Deployment:** Heroku (Backend) & Vercel (Web)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Product Review Application** is a full-stack system designed to demonstrate modern software architecture patterns. It allows users to browse products, filter by categories, view detailed reviews with AI-generated summaries, and submit their own feedback.

The project emphasizes **clean architecture, REST API design, performance optimization (pagination, server-side filtering), and cross-platform development**.

## 🎓 For Future Interns

**Assignment:** You must choose and implement **only one** of the following frontend stacks:

1. **iOS (Swift):** See [mobile/README-iOS-Swift.md](./mobile/README-iOS-Swift.md) for requirements.
2. **Android (Kotlin):** See [mobile/README-Android-Kotlin.md](./mobile/README-Android-Kotlin.md) for requirements.

> **Note:** The current `mobile/` folder contains a **React Native** implementation. This serves as a **reference** for how the UI should look and how to consume the Backend API. You are expected to build a native version (Swift or Kotlin) matching these features.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer:** Mobile/Web App (React Native, Swift, or Kotlin)
2. **API Layer:** Spring Boot REST Controllers
3. **Business Layer:** Service Interfaces & Implementations
4. **Data Layer:** JPA Repositories & Database

## 🧩 Key Features Implemented

### 🛒 Product Management

* **Server-Side Pagination:** Efficiently loads data in chunks.
* **Dynamic Filtering:** Filter products by category and reviews by rating.
* **Rating Breakdown:** Server-calculated distribution of star ratings.

### 🤖 AI Integration

* **AI Review Summary:** Automatically generates a summary of user reviews using AI logic.
* **AI Assistant:** Interactive chat interface for product queries.

### 🛠️ Technical Highlights

* **Dependency Inversion:** Controllers depend on Interfaces, not concrete classes.
* **DTO Pattern:** Strict separation between Database Entities and API responses.
* **Optimized SQL:** Custom queries for aggregation and performance.

## 🚀 Future Improvements & Technical Roadmap

### 1. Security Enhancements (Planned)

* **Spring Security Integration:** Integrate Spring Security 6.
* **JWT Authentication:** Implement stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Differentiate between Admin and User roles.
* **Secure Endpoints:** Protect sensitive actions like `POST /reviews`.

### 2. Validation with AOP (Planned)

* **Centralized Validation:** Use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to handle request validation globally.
* **Consistent Error Handling:** Unified error response structure across all endpoints.
* **Reusable Aspects:** Create custom annotations for business rules.

### 3. Integration Testing (Planned)

* **Testcontainers:** Use Docker containers to spin up real database instances for testing.
* **Reproducible Tests:** Ensure tests run consistently across different environments (CI/CD, Local).
* **End-to-End Testing:** Validate full user flows from API to Database.

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo start
```

* Press `w` for Web
* Press `a` for Android (Emulator)
* Scan QR code for iOS (Expo Go)
